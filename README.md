# FPGA-based-Dino-Runner
This project is a hardware implementation of the classic Dino Runner game, synthesized and deployed on an FPGA. 

Main code developed entirely in Verilog HDL and has a UART receiver module that takes in an input generated by OpenCV python code (person ducking/jumping).

**Key Features:**
**Custom VGA Controller:** Generates $640 \times 480$ video output, utilizing a dedicated FSM and MUX to efficiently manage the sequential drawing and animation of two main objects (Dino and Obstacle) per frame.

**Sprite-Based Graphics:** Player and obstacle graphics are stored in MIF-based block RAM (ROM), enabling detailed, animated sprites for running, jumping, and ducking states.

**Game Physics & FSM:** The player (object module) incorporates a physics state machine for jump mechanics (Running, Ascending, Descending) and handles horizontal scrolling for the obstacle.

**Collision Detection**: Real-time, pixel-accurate hitbox-based collision detection implemented in combinational logic to ensure immediate game state update upon impact.

**Peripheral Interface:** Utilizes a UART module (developed a USB protocol that could deliver same bits taken in by UART) to receive commands (Jump, Duck) from a serial terminal and displays current score and persistent high score on 7-segment displays (HEX).
